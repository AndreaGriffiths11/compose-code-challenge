    Looking good! You enabled an integration which provides Edge Includes, a convenient way to import and insert HTML into your pages on request at the edge. Let's keep going!

  <h2>Step 2: Serve images with the Netlify Image CDN</h2>
  <p>
    Now lets update the URL for the image below to serve it via the Net;ify Image CDN. Doing that gives you access to image optimisations, transformations, and high performance serving of image assets. Handy!
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Uncomment the image element below and update its <code>src</code> attribute to <code>/.netlify/images/?url=/images/ipad.png</code> so that Netlify serves it via the Image CDN rather directoy from your site's assets.</li>
    <li>Add a resized copy of the image by duplicating the <code>image</code> element in the HTML and adding a rewidth attribute like this:  <code>/.netlify/images/?url=/images/ipad.png&width=200</code></li>
    <li>Include the instructions for the final step to enter the prize draw into your site by adding another edge include as shown below.</li>
  </ol>
  <pre><code>&lt;netlify-edge-include href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philhawksworth/edge-include-extension/main/fixtures/add-blob-storage.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/netlify-edge-include&gt;</code></pre>
